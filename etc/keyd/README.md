**IMPORTANT!!** please insert your keyboard id in [id] /etc/keyd/default.conf.
                I assume the user knows what keyd and knows how to use it





# DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE ONLY INTERESTING IN default.conf 

## Very important in regards to default.conf

**What is defaut.conf.what.i.use.bak?:**
when you master default.conf and you are good and want to improve even further. then look no more. with default.conf.what.i.use.bak. You will get all the inspiration you need. This works on normal keyboard and 2 hand keyboard
Ideally you want a 2nd keyboard. But I use a small cheap every day bluetooth keyboard and it works so. no execuse

default.conf.what.i.use.bak your hand move less this is what I use I'll keep updtating that section relating ty typing fast

Here are the main highlights to why:

- Space acts as an extra modifier and a spacebar it self
- rightalt acts as an extra modifier
- rightmeta acts as an extra modifiers
- modifiers like shift, super, control, and alt can be tapped 1 time and their effects stay with you for the next 200ms so the computer is holding it for you

Holding rightalt will turn it into a ship tapping it once will turn it into 1 shift for the next 200ms

Holding space will turn your homerow capslock and asdfghjkll;'\ where you rest your hand that line in your
keyboard to the numbers layout $1234567899990!| this way you have numbers with you all the time

Holding rightmeta will turn your homerow capslock and asdfghjkll;'\ where you rest your hand that line in your
keyboard to the numbers layout ~+[{(&=)}]*%` this way you have numbers with you all the time

added in capslock if you hold capslock and semicollon you can backspace and caplsock and l adds space hjkp are the left down right up. 

Added if you hit capslock+apostrophi '\'' it will turn capslock


sadly for holding meta or holding shift the user has to double tap leftmeta or leftalt.
unless the user moves [dvorak] from it's own section [<section>] and put it in [main] in that case the issue
will be fixed but the user will never be able to have qwerty again unless the user makes a new [qwerty] layer 
and that layer will have the same issues sadly.

sadly this is necessary for now I can't think of a solution. When I get good dvorak will be my main and qwerty will be 2ndary this way only qwerty has this problem which is ok. anyways the q = toggle(dvorak) switch is easy anyways so for hotkeys and moving windows might double tap or just switch to qwerty because qwerty is nice for hotkeys I think.

I made rightalt and rightmeta and holding space for a few ms help you out.
