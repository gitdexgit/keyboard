# /etc/keyd/default.conf


# An alternative to the xkb and alias things is keyd you can put a switch in this config
# and then switch to it for example via capslock+q as shown bellow:

# Please go to keyd's github repo for more further informatin about keyd and how to set it up


# Bellow is a sample of how you can do it:

# And why we are doing it this way so that other programs work very well they think it's qwerty which means
# their default configs and everything works flawlessly. as opposed to a variant. If you have used xkb dvork
# or theprimegen's dvork through that xmodmap you will know what I mean by defaults of programs not working

# Also, You still have qwerty whenever you want to. You can chose to put dvork on [main] if you no longer care about qwerty
# this way every time keyd is ran (after reboot) you always have dvork.



# <MANDATORY>
[ids]
# The id of the keyboard that keyd will affect. which means you can have a 2nd 
# keyboard and not include it in here and it will act ok.
# I do not know if I can make certain id behave differently like in AHI library
# in AHK. 

# <PLEASE BELLOW PUT YOUR KEYBOARD ID FOR FURTHER INFORMATION TO HOW TO DO THAT VISIT KEYD GITHUB>
# I think this one is for my bluetooth keyboard
# #<This is my main keyboard>
248a:00da

# <PLEASE BELLOW PUT YOUR KEYBOARD ID FOR FURTHER INFORMATION TO HOW TO DO THAT VISIT KEYD GITHUB>
# I think this one is for my red cheap gaming old keyboard
# # <This is my 2nd keyboard that I never use just giving examples, this means if you disable it your 2nd keyboard will be and behave normally nothing in this config will apply to it>
